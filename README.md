# Project Description - A website generate healthy diet plan for customers and buy products from app itself and also help to decide your food according to your mood.

# The problem statement - Difficulty in planning healthy diet and manage grocery shopping efficiently.

# Solution - Creating a website or app that generates healthy diet plans, offers a built-in product marketplace, and provides mood-based food recommendations can be an innovative and holistic solution for users looking to improve their eating habits. This platform can begin with a Healthy Diet Plan Generator, where users input their personal details like age, gender, weight, height, activity level, and dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto, vegetarian). They can also specify their health goals, such as weight loss, weight gain, or maintaining weight. Based on this input, the platform can create personalized meal plans with detailed nutritional information, including calorie distribution, protein, carbs, and vitamin content.
